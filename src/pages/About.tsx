    bio: "Yewoinshet Masresha, the visionary founder of Hope for Children Organization (HFCO), is a woman whose life has been shaped by compassion, courage, and a deep love for humanity. Born in Babile, a town nestled between Jigjiga and Harar in Ethiopia's Harari region, Yewoinshet grew up with a natural sense of empathy and a passion for helping those in need. From a young age, she demonstrated critical thinking, an unwavering sense of justice, and an unshakable commitment to the well-being of others.\n\nShe pursued her undergraduate studies in Literature at Addis Ababa University, and later earned a Master's degree in Social Psychology. Her academic journey strengthened her understanding of human behavior and deepened her resolve to serve the most vulnerable members of society. Before founding HFCO, Yewoinshet worked with a Catholic missionary charity as a social worker, where she provided care and support to disadvantaged individuals and families.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Ethiopia was among the countries hardest hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, a crisis that not only caused widespread loss of life but also left thousands of children orphaned and stigmatized. Witnessing the despair faced by affected families, Yewoinshet was moved to act. With grace, courage, and determination, she began offering home-based care services to bedridden HIV/AIDS patients bringing comfort, dignity, and hope into their lives.\n\nStarting with just one group home sheltering eight children, she envisioned a new kind of family one built not by blood, but by love, commitment, and care. Each group home was led by a dedicated mother caring for 8â€“10 children as her own. Over time, this heartfelt initiative grew to 12 group homes, nurturing 130 children in a safe and loving environment. Through HFCO, Yewoinshet created not just shelters, but homes filled with hope and healing.\n\nFor more than 18 years, she served HFCO in multiple roles volunteer, psychologist, project manager, and executive director often sacrificing her personal interests and comfort to ensure the organization's success. Though she now resides in Australia for retirement due to her service for long years, Yewoinshet continues to guide HFCO's strategic direction and supports the organization through personal donations and mentorship.\n\nTo this day, the lives of over 130 children she raised through HFCO stand as a living testament to her compassion. Many have grown into independent, accomplished individuals holding key positions in society. Her legacy lives on through the hearts she's touched, the lives she's transformed, and the enduring family she built through love.",
